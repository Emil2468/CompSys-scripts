# CompSys scripts

Scripts to hopefully help complete CompSys exam. Everything is, and probably should be, written in javascript, such that it can be copied and pasted into the console in a browser. If something is missing feel free to create a pull request with more scripts or additions to existing, alternatively, if you dont have the time or the JS-skills, you can open an issue. 

Should you find bugs you can either open an issue descriping the bug, or create a pull request with a fix.

All scripts come with a best effort guarantee :)
