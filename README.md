# CompSys scripts

Scripts to hopefully help complete CompSys exam. Everything is, and probably should be, written in javascript, such that it can be copied and pasted into the console in a browser. If something is missing feel free to create a pull request with more scripts or additions to existing, alternatively, if you dont have the time or the JS-skills, you can open an issue. 

Should you find bugs you can either open an issue descriping the bug, or create a pull request with a fix.

## How to use:
* Open browser
* Open console in browser
  * Either by pressing f12, <code>ctrl + shift + i</code> or rigth clicking and choosing inspect element
  * Then chose the tab "console"
* Copy and paste the wanted script(s) into the console, you can now call the defined functions directly from the browser console

All scripts come with a best effort guarantee :)
